## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on input features using the `heart.csv` dataset. The core logic is in `Code.py`.

You can load the dataset, preprocess it, train a model, evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.), and make predictions on new data.

## Features

- Load and process the `heart.csv` dataset  
- Train a classification model (you would specify which algorithm: e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.)  
- Evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)  
- (Optional) Predict on new instances  
- (Optional) Save the trained model  

## Dataset

The repository includes `heart.csv`, which contains patient data with features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., along with a target label indicating presence or absence of heart disease.

You can provide more details:

- Number of rows / columns  
- What each column means  
- Distribution of classes (how many positive vs negative)  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgumShrivastava/Minor.git
   cd Minor
